/* Project: Combat Simulator
 * File: main.cpp
 *
 * Description:
 *  Incredibly simple prototype that allows creating
 * many units of different types, and seeing them battle,
 * choosing random enemies and dealing random damage.
 *  User can create new types of units giving them a name,
 * max health, damage, and speed, then this information is stored,
 * and each unit of the type remembers where.
 *  As there might be many many units of the same type, having
 * them all store the same information is inefficient, and
 * this implementation avoids that by using smart pointers.
 *  Original implementation included complex initiative
 * and targetting systems, but was too messy to share.
